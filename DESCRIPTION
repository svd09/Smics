Description: This package is a compilation of various miscellanous functions
that I have created while working on projects. The functions are somtimes 
heavily borrowed from other libraries. I have attempted to cite all the sources
where possible. If anyone is left out, please attribute that to my dumbness; that 
was not my intention. As the addage goes: 
    "To look further ... we need to stand on the shoulder of giants.
