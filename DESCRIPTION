Description: This package is a compilation of various miscellanous functions
  that I have created while working on projects. The functions are sometimes 
  heavily borrowed from other libraries. I have attempted to cite all the sources
  where possible. If anyone is left out, please attribute that to my dumbness; that 
  was not my intention. As the addage goes: 
    "To look further ... we need to stand on the shoulder of giants.
